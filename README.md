🐸 Green Frog – A Website for Environmental Protection
For my Semester 3 project, I developed Green Frog, a web application focused on environmental protection. The project was built using C# and ASP.NET MVC, with a structured backend and an interactive frontend.

🌍 The Beginning of My Web Development Journey
That first website was just the beginning. Since then, I've explored MVC architecture, backend development with C#, and database integration to build more complex and interactive applications.

🛒 E-commerce for Eco-Friendly Products
The website was designed as an eco-friendly online store, where users could:
✅ Browse and purchase environmentally friendly products
✅ Learn about sustainable living and eco-friendly solutions
✅ Engage with a community promoting green initiatives

🛠 Key Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI/UX improvements)

Backend: C# with ASP.NET MVC framework

Database: SQL Server for managing products and orders

Authentication: Secure user login and registration system

🔥 Looking Back
This first experience with web development was a turning point that sparked my passion for coding and building interactive applications. It also helped me understand the importance of technology in promoting environmental awareness.

🌿 Green Frog wasn’t just a project—it was my first step into the world of full-stack development! 🚀
